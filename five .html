    <ul>
        <li>Peace</li>
        <p>protect your peace. I used to become really affected by my surroundings. If my space was negative, I had to work hard
        not to spiral into a negative mindset. The truth is, life isn’t easy, and remaining in our quaint comfort zones doesn’t
        open the window for change.</p>
        <li>Health</li>
        <p>So many of us take our health for granted until something life-changing happens, and our health becomes at risk. With
        good health, anything is possible. Without it, you cannot live life to its fullest. It is vital to take care of your
        mind, body and soul.</p>
        <li>Family and Friendship</li>
        <p>You must devote time, love and energy to nurture your family relationships – not just for the sake of your family, but
        for yourself.</p>
        

        <li>Purpose</li>
        <p>Purpose is our “why.” It drives our every action and fuels our passion. It encompasses our work, our relationships,
            and
            our approach to living our best lives. Our purpose wraps around everything we do in our lives. To live a fulfilling
            life, we must have a purpose – a goal, an outcome we want to achieve as we walk this Earth. I feel like I truly
            started
            living when I found my purpose.</p>

        <li>
            Time

        </li>
        <p>We can take control by saying “yes” to less and appreciating the blank space in our diary. We can protect our precious
        time, saving it for the activities and people that give our lives the most meaning and joy.</p>

        <li>Learning</li>
        <p>Life is a gift and it is our responsibility to get the most of out of it. It is critical that you always invest in
        developing your knowledge and skills.</p>
        <li>Love</li>
        <p>I have always said, we were put on this earth simply to love. Love one another, love what we do, love the Earth, and
        love each moment we are blessed to experience.</p>
    </ul>
